            for each major climate on Earth.

            - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling
            American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer.
            It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.

            Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet
            the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not
            inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
            plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it
            science, people were selecting the best breeds."
